This download contains csv output (Tokens csv files) generated by Ubiqu+Ity (v 1.2; dictionary v3.21), a dictionary-based 
text tagger. Ubiqu+Ity serves as a frontend application that utilizes DocuScope dictionaries, which classify linguistic 
patterns into categories of rhetorical effects. DocuScope is the work of David Kaufer and Suguru Ishizaki at the English 
Department of Carnegie Mellon University. Ubiqu+Ity is the work of the Visualizing English Print project (VEP), made possible by a grant 
from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Credit for Ubiqu+Ity goes to Erin Winter (wintere@cs.wisc.edu), Eric Alexander (ealexand@cs.wisc.edu), and Joe Kohlmann (kohlmannj@mac.com) under the supervision of Michael Gleicher (gleicher@cs.wisc.edu).

The material in this download was generated from VEP's Early Modern Drama Collection. For more information about the corpus and collection, visit http://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/WP/vep/vep-early-modern-drama-collection/.
