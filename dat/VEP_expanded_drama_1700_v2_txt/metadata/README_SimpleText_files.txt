The plain text files provided in this download are in a SimpleText format, a highly simplified ASCII representation of the contents of TEI-encoded XML files. This format strips annotations and metadata. Learn more about SimpleText here: http://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/WP/vep/simpletext/.

This corpus was curated by the efforts of the Visualizing English Print Project (VEP), made possible by a grant 
from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and a license agreement with the University of Michigan Libraries. For its 
source files, the VEP used Text Creation Partnership (TCP) TEI-P4 XML-encoded electronic text editions of early 
print books from ECCO-TCP, EBBO-TCP Phase I, EEBO-TCP Phase II, and Evans-TCP corpora. Our license with TCP providers allows us to share ECCO-TCP texts, EVANS-TCP texts, and EEBO-TCP Phase I texts, but not EEBO-TCP Phase II texts. Information provided about Phase II texts is granted through license 
with Michigan University Libraries for scholarly analysis.

The Expanded Drama 1700 corpus contains 1,244 texts in total, 235 of which cannot be distributed because they are generated from restricted EEBO-TCP Phase II content. (See tcp_restricted.txt for a list of restricted files in this corpus.) 

The TCP XML source files for this corpus (not included in this download) underwent several transformations to prepare their text transcriptions for 
computational processing prior to release as The Expanded Drama 1700 corpus. The workflow for text extraction was supervised by VEP PI Mike Gleicher 
(gleicher@cs.wisc.edu) in collaboration with Jonathan Hope (jonathan.r.hope@strath.ac.uk). The XML files were processed by several Python scripts to ensure standard character encodings 
and spelling standardization. The Python scripts were the collective work of Wei-chen Chen (zarcen@cs.wisc.edu), 
Erin Winter (wintere@cs.wisc.edu), Eric Alexander (ealexand@cs.wisc.edu), and Deidre Stuffer (stuffer@wisc.edu). Learn more here: http://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/WP/vep/workflow/.
